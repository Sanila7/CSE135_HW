### Third Approach Analytics Platform: Matomo
For my third analytics approach, I evaluated Matomo (formerly Piwik), an open-source analytics platform. I chose Matomo because it provides comprehensive user insights including:

User location - Geographic data showing where visitors are accessing the site from
Operating system - Detailed breakdown of what OS users are running (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.)
Device information - Data on whether users are on desktop, mobile, or tablet, including specific device models, in addition to resolution on their device
User actions within the website - Tracking of clicks, page views, navigation paths, and specific interactions throughout the site

Analysis: I really liked how simple Matomo was to set up and immediately start tracking user activity on my website; it's ease of us was better than Google Analytics and LogRocket.
