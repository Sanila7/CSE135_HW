    Hi! My name is <strong>Sanila Silva</strong>, and I am a third-year
    <strong>Computer Science</strong> major. I enjoy building things with
    technology and learning how systems work from both a software and
    infrastructure perspective.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of academics, I love watching sports and keeping up with different
    leagues and teams. I’m also really into collecting fragrances and learning
    about how different scent profiles are created. When I’m not studying or
    working on projects, you’ll usually find me at the gym staying active.
